oha is a tiny program that sends some load to a web application and show realtime tui inspired by [rakyll/hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey).

This program is written in Rust and powered by [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) and beautiful tui by [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui).

# Installation

This program is built on stable Rust, with both `make` and `cmake` prerequisites to install via cargo.

    cargo install oha

You can optionally build oha against [native-tls](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-native-tls) instead of [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls).

    cargo install --no-default-features --features native-tls oha

You can enable VSOCK support by enabling `vsock` feature.

    cargo install --features vsock oha

You can enable experimental HTTP3 support by enabling the `http3` feature. This uses the [H3](https://github.com/hyperium/h3/r) library by the developers of Hyper.
It will remain experimental as long as H3 is experimental. It currently depends on using `rustls` for TLS.

## Download pre-built binary

You can download pre-built binary from [Release page](https://github.com/hatoo/oha/releases) for each version and from [Publish workflow](https://github.com/hatoo/oha/actions/workflows/release.yml) and [Publish PGO workflow](https://github.com/hatoo/oha/actions/workflows/release-pgo.yml) for each commit.

## On Arch Linux

    pacman -S oha

## On macOS (Homebrew)

    brew install oha

## On Windows (winget)

    winget install hatoo.oha

## On Debian ([Azlux's repository](http://packages.azlux.fr/))

    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/azlux-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.azlux.fr/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azlux.list
    sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/azlux-archive-keyring.gpg https://azlux.fr/repo.gpg
    apt update
    apt install oha

## X-CMD (Linux, macOS, Windows WSL/GitBash)

You can install with [x-cmd](https://www.x-cmd.com).

```sh
x env use oha
```

## Containerized

You can also build and create a container image including oha

```sh
docker build -t hatoo/oha:latest .
```

Then you can use oha directly through the container

```sh
docker run --rm -it --network=host hatoo/oha:latest https://example.com:3000
```

## Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO)

You can build `oha` with PGO by using the following commands:

```sh
bun run pgo.js
```

And the binary will be available at `target/[target-triple]/pgo/oha`.

# Platform

- Linux - Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 gnome-terminal
- Windows 10 - Tested on Windows Powershell
- MacOS - Tested on iTerm2

# Usage

`-q` option works different from [rakyll/hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey). It's set overall query per second instead of for each workers.

```sh
Ohayou(おはよう), HTTP load generator, inspired by rakyll/hey with tui animation.

Usage: oha [OPTIONS] <URL>

Arguments:
  <URL>  Target URL or file with multiple URLs.

Options:
  -n <N_REQUESTS>
          Number of requests to run. Accepts plain numbers or suffixes: k = 1,000, m = 1,000,000 (e.g. 10k, 1m). [default: 200]
  -c <N_CONNECTIONS>
          Number of connections to run concurrently. You may should increase limit to number of open files for larger `-c`. [default: 50]
  -p <N_HTTP2_PARALLEL>
          Number of parallel requests to send on HTTP/2. `oha` will run c * p concurrent workers in total. [default: 1]
  -z <DURATION>
          Duration of application to send requests.
          On HTTP/1, When the duration is reached, ongoing requests are aborted and counted as "aborted due to deadline"
          You can change this behavior with `-w` option.
          Currently, on HTTP/2, When the duration is reached, ongoing requests are waited. `-w` option is ignored.
          Examples: -z 10s -z 3m.
  -w, --wait-ongoing-requests-after-deadline
          When the duration is reached, ongoing requests are waited
  -q <QUERY_PER_SECOND>
          Rate limit for all, in queries per second (QPS)
      --burst-delay <BURST_DURATION>
          Introduce delay between a predefined number of requests.
          Note: If qps is specified, burst will be ignored
      --burst-rate <BURST_REQUESTS>
          Rates of requests for burst. Default is 1
          Note: If qps is specified, burst will be ignored
      --rand-regex-url
          Generate URL by rand_regex crate but dot is disabled for each query e.g. http://127.0.0.1/[a-z][a-z][0-9]. Currently dynamic scheme, host and port with keep-alive do not work well. See https://docs.rs/rand_regex/latest/rand_regex/struct.Regex.html for details of syntax.
      --urls-from-file
          Read the URLs to query from a file
      --max-repeat <MAX_REPEAT>
          A parameter for the '--rand-regex-url'. The max_repeat parameter gives the maximum extra repeat counts the x*, x+ and x{n,} operators will become. [default: 4]
      --dump-urls <DUMP_URLS>
          Dump target Urls <DUMP_URLS> times to debug --rand-regex-url
      --latency-correction
          Correct latency to avoid coordinated omission problem. It's ignored if -q is not set.
      --no-tui
          No realtime tui
      --fps <FPS>
          Frame per second for tui. [default: 16]

          HTTP Accept Header.
  -d <BODY_STRING>
          HTTP request body.
  -D <BODY_PATH>
          HTTP request body from file.
  -Z <BODY_PATH_LINES>

# Performance

`oha` uses faster implementation when `--no-tui` option is set and both `-q` and `--burst-delay` are not set because it can avoid overhead to gather data realtime.

# Output

By default `oha` outputs a text summary of the results.

`oha` prints JSON summary output when `--output-format json` option is set.
The schema of JSON output is defined in [schema.json](./schema.json).

When `--output-format csv` is used result of each request is printed as a line of comma separated values.

# Tips

## Stress test in more realistic condition

`oha` uses default options inherited from [rakyll/hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey) but you may need to change options to stress test in more realistic condition.

I suggest to run `oha` with following options.

```sh
oha <-z or -n> -c <number of concurrent connections> -q <query per seconds> --latency-correction --disable-keepalive <target-address>
```

- --disable-keepalive

    In real, user doesn't query same URL using [Keep-Alive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Keep-Alive). You may want to run without `Keep-Alive`.
- --latency-correction

    You can avoid `Coordinated Omission Problem` by using `--latency-correction`.

## Burst feature

You can use `--burst-delay` along with `--burst-rate` option to introduce delay between a defined number of requests.

```sh
oha -n 10 --burst-delay 2s --burst-rate 4
```

In this particular scenario, every 2 seconds, 4 requests will be processed, and after 6s the total of 10 requests will be processed.
*NOTE: If you don't set `--burst-rate` option, the amount is default to 1*

## Dynamic url feature

You can use `--rand-regex-url` option to generate random url for each connection.

```sh
oha --rand-regex-url http://127.0.0.1/[a-z][a-z][0-9]
```

Each Urls are generated by [rand_regex](https://github.com/kennytm/rand_regex) crate but regex's dot is disabled since it's not useful for this purpose and it's very inconvenient if url's dots are interpreted as regex's dot.

Optionally you can set `--max-repeat` option to limit max repeat count for each regex. e.g http://127.0.0.1/[a-z]* with `--max-repeat 4` will generate url like http://127.0.0.1/[a-z]{0,4}

Currently dynamic scheme, host and port with keep-alive are not works well.

## URLs from file feature

You can use `--urls-from-file` to read the target URLs from a file. Each line of this file needs to contain one valid URL as in the example below.

```
http://domain.tld/foo/bar
http://domain.tld/assets/vendors-node_modules_highlight_js_lib_index_js-node_modules_tanstack_react-query_build_modern-3fdf40-591fb51c8a6e.js
http://domain.tld/images/test.png
http://domain.tld/foo/bar?q=test
http://domain.tld/foo
```

Such a file can for example be created from an access log to generate a more realistic load distribution over the different pages of a server. 

When this type of URL specification is used, every request goes to a random URL given in the file.

# Contribution

Feel free to help us!

Here are some areas which need improving.

- Write tests
- Improve tui design.
  - Show more information?
- Improve speed
  - I'm new to tokio. I think there are some space to optimize query scheduling.
